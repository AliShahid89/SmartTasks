**SmartTasks: A Modular and Clean iOS Task Management App.**

SmartTasks is an iOS app designed to help users manage their daily tasks efficiently. The app leverages a modular UI architecture, based on reusable UI components, and follows the VIP (View-Interactor-Presenter) or clean architecture principles.

Features:
- Daily Task Overview: See your tasks for the day at a glance.
- Navigation: Navigate between days to view past and upcoming tasks.
- No Tasks View: A visually appealing view when there are no tasks scheduled.
- Customizable UI: Easily adapt the app's look and feel using modular components.
- Clean Architecture: The codebase is organized and maintainable due to the VIP architecture.

Architecture:
SmartTasks is built upon a modular UI foundation, using reusable UI components to create a consistent and flexible user interface. The core architecture follows the VIP (View-Interactor-Presenter) design pattern, promoting separation of concerns and testability:

- View: Responsible for displaying information and capturing user input.
- Interactor: Handles business logic and interacts with data models.
- Presenter: Formats data from the interactor for presentation in the view.
- Router: Manages navigation between screens.
